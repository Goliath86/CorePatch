Added:
	now the Garbage Collector Module has all the improvements that Wolffy.au and zGuba have made in their BIS Module Improvment Project (http://dev.withsix.com/projects/mip)

Changed:
	Now the Garbage Collector Module start automatically collecting not alive units. It scan every 300 secs (default) for not alive units and delete them if the player and/or his units are over 500 meters (default) distant from the "dead" unit (this was introduced by Wolffy.au in his project). Now the mission maker can modify the time for the scan by settings a global variable (BIS_GC setVariable ["waitTime", timeInSecs, true];). He can already set the distance from the player and his units at which the module delete the not alive units (BIS_GC setVariable ["distanceObject", metersFromThePlayers, true];) and last, he can set if a unit doesn't have to be deleted by the Garbage Collector Module by putting this "BIS_GC setVariable ["dontDelete", true, true]" inside the init box of the unit to not be deleted.
